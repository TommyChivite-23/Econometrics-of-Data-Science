// Economic Factors Affecting the Quality of Sleep
Research about the influence of economic factors (age, income, work hours, employment status) on sleep duration, analyzing a diverse U.S. data sample. This study was done through "Language R" where the study identified a correlation between income and sleep, modern factors like increased cellphone use, telecommuting trends, and post-pandemic job uncertainties that affected this relationship. Our aim is not pinpointing causation but discerning any changes in the sleep-socioeconomic link compared to earlier data.
